This repository accompanies the paper:
Shanshan Tian, Longtao Huangfu, et al. Causal Associations of Sleep Traits with Cancer Incidence and Mortality, Nature Communications, Pre-review, 2023.

## Environment details
All data analysis processes are based on the Linux system Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-58-generic x86_64) environment. We created an independent analysis environment through the miniconda3 program. R v4.1.3, Python v3.7.12, and Java openjdk v1.8.0_352 were mainly used. The deployment file has been uploaded.

All individual participant data is processed using the UK Biobank
